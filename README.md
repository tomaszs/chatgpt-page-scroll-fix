## Perfect for Web Apps Like ChatGPT

Many modern web apps disable or override native key scrolling, making navigation frustrating. This script solves that problem for:
- **ChatGPT**: Ensure Home, End, PageUp, and PageDown keys work as expected.
- **Web Apps with Custom Interfaces**: Fix scrolling in apps that donâ€™t natively support these keys.

2. Dynamically calculates the target scroll position and animates scrolling smoothly.
3. Increases scroll speed for rapid key presses.
4. Preserves default behavior for text inputs, textareas, and contenteditable elements.
